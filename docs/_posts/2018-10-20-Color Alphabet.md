# Color Alphabet

I decided to identify every character in the game based on their primary color. Unfortunately, some of the common color names start with the same character so in those cases I reserved the character for the most common color. On the other hand, for some of the characters, I couldn't come up with a good color.

In the end, I left with 12 colors. The black and the white, the 3 primary colors with azure instead of blue, the 3 secondary colors, and 4 additional ones.

I left out material names like silver, gold, diamond, emerald, etc. because they might be confusing as a color of a character's attribute. e.g a diamond scaled monster would sound tougher than it really is.

So here are the full list of colors:
* Azure #007FFF
* Black #000000
* Cyan #00FFFF
* D
* E
* F
* Green #008000
* H
* I
* J
* K
* L
* Magenta #FF00FF
* N
* Orange #FFA500
* Pink #FFC0CB
* Q
* Red #FF0000
* S
* Teal #FFC0CB
* U
* Violet #8F00FF
* White #FFFFFF
* X
* Yellow #FFFF00
* Z
